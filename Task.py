## Explaining the Methodology Adopted for this Task ##

# The given Python code implements a function `price_contract` that calculates the profit or loss obtained by 
# undertaking trades on given dates for a contract involving the buying, storing, and selling of natural gas the
# storage cost of the gas, the injection/withdrawal. The value of the contract is the profit or loss obtained by
# undertaking the trades on given dates. Play around with the parameters and you'll be able to see this. 
# In the end the intent for this function returns the value of the contract.
#The function takes in eight inputs:
#- `in_dates`: A list of dates on which the gas is being injected into the storage facility.
#- `in_prices`: A list of prices of gas on each of the injection dates.
#- `out_dates`: A list of dates on which the gas is being withdrawn from the storage facility.
#- `out_prices`: A list of prices of gas on each of the withdrawal dates.
#- `rate`: The rate of gas in cubic feet per day.
#- `storage_cost_rate`: A fixed monthly fee to store the gas
#- `total_vol`: The total volume of gas in cubic feet that can be stored.
#- `injection_withdrawal_cost_rate`: The injection/withdrawal cost of gas in dollars per cubic foot.

# The function first ensures that all the dates are in sequence and sorted in ascending order. Then, it iterates
#over all the dates and calculates the cash flows on each date. If the current date is an injection date, it
#injects gas into the storage facility and calculates the cost to store the gas, the cost to purchase the gas,
#and the injection cost. If the current date is a withdrawal date, it withdraws gas from the storage facility and
#calculates the cash inflow from selling the gas, the cost to store the remaining gas, and the withdrawal cost.

# Finally, the function returns the net profit or loss by subtracting the storage cost and the cost to purchase 
#the gas from the cash inflow from selling the gas.

# The example usage of the `price_contract` function calculates the profit or loss for a contract that involves
#injecting gas on four different dates and withdrawing gas on four different dates, each with a different price. 
#The other inputs such as the rate of gas, the storage cost rate, the total volume, and the injection/withdrawal 
#cost rate are also provided. The output is printed to the console using an f-string.
